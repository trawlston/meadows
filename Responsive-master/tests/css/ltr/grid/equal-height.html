                    a center of commerce and culture known as Korad. It had been built upon a beautiful,
                    natural harbor, landlocked by magnificent hills. The little valley on the west front of the
                    city, she explained, was all that remained of the harbor, while the pass through the hills
                    to the old sea bottom had been the channel through which the shipping passed up to the city's
                    gates.
